# Project Title

This is a simple test harness to showcase Lottie animations for the web. 
**Feel free to modify to test different animations/features.**

Lottie is a JS library developed by AirBnB for Android, iOS, Web, and Windows that parses Adobe After Effects animations and renders them natively on mobile and on the web.

It can be used to embed complex animations and transitions into a web page or app that a developer would not consider hand crafting themselves using CSS, JavaScript or native app code.

Animations are created in After Effects and exported as JSON using a plugin. The Lottie library then makes it very simple to embed the animation in your app.

A designer can create incredible complex animations, even 3D, with very little effort needed by the developer.
